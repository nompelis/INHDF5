# INHDF5
A mini API for using (programming) the parallel HDF5 library in Fortran

SUMMARY

1. Quick ways to create and use files/groups/datasets in a distributed parallel
program written in Fortran.


USING THE LIBRARY

- Compiling

Compile just as you would a distributed parallel program with MPI and HDF5.


- Using this API

Look at what the code does (it is obvious) and just built on top of it or use
it as is. There is nothing to it... All these are shortcuts for the simple
operations that would otherwise need error-trapping to be repeated over and
over.


MOTIVATION

The things that can be kept generic, should be kept as generic as possible.
